# The SeattleTestbed `common` repository has two dependencies so that 
# it can be built for unit testing: `utf`, and `common` itself.
# (You can't really build a standalone runnable component out of it, 
# see the comments in config_build.txt in this directory).
#
# We check out a fresh copy of `common` into the `DEPENDENCIES` subdir 
# for building so that we don't have to fiddle with import paths in 
# SeattleTestbed/buildscripts/build.py for just this specific repo.
# 
# The copy of `common` checked out is only used during building the 
# unit tests --- the code tested later is taken from this config file's 
# parent directory, i.e. usually your working copy.
