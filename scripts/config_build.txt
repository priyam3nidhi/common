# SeattleTestbed/common isn't really a standalone component, 
# it's part of the build harness for the other repos. Therefore, 
# there are no non-`test` directives.
#
# It is unit-testable however, and here is what we need for this:
test ./
test DEPENDENCIES/utf/*
test DEPENDENCIES/utf/tests/*
DEPENDENCIES/common/* test1 
DEPENDENCIES/common/utf/* test2
DEPENDENCIES/repy_v2/* test3

# Tests
test DEPENDENCIES/utf/tests/*
# Subdir
DEPENDENCIES/seattlelib_v2/* subdir_seattlelib_v2/v2/
test DEPENDENCIES/repy_v2/* subdir_repy_v2/v2/
